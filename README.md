# Countdown
A countdown timer made with Python

## Features
- Frequent updates (as long as I can keep thinking of things to add)
- The ability to save data to Home Assistant (given enough setup) or local files
- Custom themes (fonts/colors)
- Autosaving new events/themes
- Color change based on time until event

## Possible features that I may add:
- The ability to save to multiple locations at once (for instance, `data.json` as well as Home Assistant)
- Add tabs to the theme creation process
- Resizable GUI
